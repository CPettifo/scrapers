# scrapers
This repo will contain a bunch of different tests and projects for my own webscrapers.

## Goals
I want to learn how to combine some shell scripts to automate web queries made using Python (and perhaps other languages later).
Eventually if enough data is gathered I could start to play around using some SQL or other DB languages.
